# Question 1

##### Import dataset from CSV file.

``` r
homicide = read_csv("homicide-data.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names()
```

*This dataset includes 52179 observations and 12 variables, reporting
the date, the city, the state, the coordinates of the incidences, the
victims’ name, age, race, gender, and the disposition of the case. The
incidences are reported across 28 states from 2007-2017.*

##### Create a city_state variable (e.g. “Baltimore, MD”), and a binary variable indicating whether the homicide is solved. Omit cities Dallas, TX; Phoenix, AZ; and Kansas City, MO – these don’t report victim race. Also omit Tulsa, AL – this is a data entry mistake. For this problem, limit your analysis those for whom victim_race is white or black. Be sure that victim_age is numeric.

``` r
cleaned_homicide =
  homicide %>%
  mutate(city_state = str_c(city, ", ", state)) %>% 
  mutate(solved = ifelse(disposition %in% c("Closed by arrest","Closed without arrest"), 1, 0)) %>%
  filter(!city_state %in% c("Dallas, TX", "Phoenix, AZ", "Kansas City, MO", "Tulsa, AL")) %>%
  filter(victim_race %in% c("White", "Black")) %>%
  mutate(victim_age = ifelse(victim_age == "unknown", NA, victim_age)) %>%
  mutate(victim_age = as.numeric(victim_age))


cleaned_homicide

##### For the city of Baltimore, MD, use the glm function to fit a logistic regression with resolved vs unresolved as the outcome and victim age, sex and race as predictors. Save the output of glm as an R object; apply the broom::tidy to this object; and obtain the estimate and confidence interval of the adjusted odds ratio for solving homicides comparing male victims to female victims keeping all other variables fixed.

``` r
baltimore_glm =
  cleaned_homicide %>%
  filter(city_state == "Baltimore, MD") %>%
  filter(victim_race %in% c("White", "Black")) %>% 
  glm(solved ~ victim_age + victim_sex + victim_race, 
             data =., 
             family = binomial) %>% 
  broom::tidy(baltimore_glm, 
              exponentiate = TRUE, 
              conf.int = TRUE, 
              conf.level = 0.95) %>% 
  rename(OR = estimate, 
         ci_lower = conf.low, 
         ci_upper = conf.high,
         p_value = p.value) %>%
  mutate(p_value = ifelse(p_value < 0.05, "<0.05", as.character(round(p_value, 3)))) %>%
  select(term, OR, ci_lower, ci_upper, p_value) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 3)

baltimore_glm
```

| term             |    OR | ci_lower | ci_upper | p_value |
|:-----------------|------:|---------:|---------:|:--------|
| (Intercept)      | 1.942 |    1.383 |    2.744 | \<0.05  |
| victim_age       | 0.995 |    0.988 |    1.001 | 0.11    |
| victim_sexMale   | 0.355 |    0.267 |    0.468 | \<0.05  |
| victim_raceWhite | 2.459 |    1.733 |    3.519 | \<0.05  |

*With the `female` being the reference category for sex and `Black`
being the reference category for race: the odds of having the homicide
case solved among female victims is 0.355 times the odds of having
homicide case solved among male victims. Since the p-value is smaller
than 0.05, we have sufficient evidence to claim that the odds of having
the homicide case solved are significantly different between male and
female victims.*
